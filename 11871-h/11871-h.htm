<h2>THE ALHAMBRA.</h2>
<blockquote>
<h4><i>By Geoffrey Crayon, author of the Sketch Book,
&amp;c.</i></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>What! Washington Irving, or, as the title-page will have it,
Geoffrey Crayon, in SPAIN, wandering up and down the deserted halls
of the Alhambra, and weaving its legendary lore with thick coming
fancies into sketches of enchanting interest. The origin of the
work, (the <i>New Sketch Book</i>,) as it has been inappropriately
styled, is told in the dedication to David Wilkie, Esq., R.A. Mr.
Irving and the great artist just named were fellow travellers on
the continent a few years since. In their rambles about some of the
old cities of Spain, they were more than once struck with scenes
and incidents which reminded them of passages in the "Arabian
Nights." The painter urged Mr. Irving to write something that
should illustrate those peculiarities, "something in the Haroun
Alrasched style" that should have a dash of that Arabian spice
which pervades every thing in Spain. The author set to work, <i>con
amore,</i> and has produced two goodly volumes, with a few
"Arabesque" sketches and tales founded on popular traditions. His
<i>study</i> was THE ALHAMBRA, which must have inspired him for his
task. To quote his own words: "how many legends and traditions,
true and fabulous; how many songs and romances, Spanish and
Arabian, of love and war, and chivalry, are associated with this
romantic pile." The Governor of the Alhambra gave Mr. Irving and
his companion, permission to occupy his vacant apartments in the
Moorish Palace. "My companion," says the author, "was soon summoned
away by the duties of his station; but I remained for several
months, spellbound in the old enchanted pile."</p>
<p>Such is the plan or frame of the work before us. It has induced
us to select the Embellishments on the annexed page; and their
description, from so graceful a pencil as that of the author, will,
we hope, bespeak the favour of the reader.</p>
<p>"The Alhambra is an ancient fortress or castellated palace of
the Moorish kings of Granada, where they held dominion over this
their boasted terrestrial paradise, and made their last stand for
empire in Spain. The palace occupies but a portion of the fortress,
the walls of which, studded with towers, stretch irregularly round
the whole crest of a lofty hill that overlooks the city, and forms
a spur of the Sierra Nevada, or snowy mountain.</p>
<p>"In the time of the Moors, the fortress was capable of
containing an army of forty thousand men within its precincts, and
served occasionally as a stronghold of the sovereigns against their
rebellious subjects. After the kingdom had passed into the hands of
the Christians, the Alhambra continued a royal demesne, and was
occasionally inhabited by the Castilian monarchs. The Emperor
Charles V. began a sumptuous palace within its walls, but was
deterred from completing it by repeated shocks of earthquakes. The
last royal residents were Philip V. and his beautiful queen
Elizabetta of Parma, early in the eighteenth century. Great
preparations were made for their reception. The palace and gardens
were placed in a state of repair, and a new suite of apartments
erected, and decorated by artists brought from Italy. The sojourn
of the sovereigns was transient, and after their departure the
palace once more became desolate. Still the place was maintained
with some military state. The governor held it immediately from the
crown, its jurisdiction extended down into the suburbs of the city,
and was independent of the captain general of Granada. A
considerable garrison was kept up, the governor had his apartments
in the front of the old Moorish palace, and never descended into
Granada without some military parade. The fortress, in fact, was a
little town of itself, having several streets of houses within its
walls, together with a Franciscan convent and a parochial
church.</p>
<p>"The desertion of the court, however, was a fatal blow to the
Alhambra. Its beautiful halls became desolate, and some of them
fell to ruin; the gardens were destroyed, and the fountains ceased
to play. By degrees the dwellings became filled up with a loose and
lawless population; contrabandistas, who availed themselves of its
independent jurisdiction to carry on a wide and daring course of
smuggling, and thieves and rogues of all sorts, who made this their
place of refuge from whence they might depredate upon Granada and
its vicinity. The strong arm of government at length interfered:
the whole community was thoroughly sifted; none were suffered to
remain but such as were of honest character, and had legitimate
right to a residence; the greater part of the houses were
demolished and a mere hamlet left, with the parochial church and
the Franciscan convent. During the recent troubles in Spain, when
Granada was in the hands of the French, the Alhambra was garrisoned
by their troops, and the palace was occasionally <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg 339]</span>
inhabited by the French commander. With that enlightened taste
which has ever distinguished the French nation in their conquests,
this monument of Moorish elegance and grandeur was rescued from the
absolute ruin and desolation that were overwhelming it. The roofs
were repaired, the saloons and galleries protected from the
weather, the gardens cultivated, the water courses restored, the
fountains once more made to throw up their sparkling showers; and
Spain may thank her invaders for having preserved to her the most
beautiful and interesting of her historical monuments.</p>
<p>"On the departure of the French they blew up several towers of
the outer wall, and left the fortifications scarcely tenable. Since
that time the military importance of the post is at an end. The
garrison is a handful of invalid soldiers, whose principal duty is
to guard some of the outer towers, which serve occasionally as a
prison of state; and the governor, abandoning the lofty hill of the
Alhambra, resides in the centre of Granada, for the more convenient
dispatch of his official duties.</p>
<h4><i>Interior of the Alhambra</i>.</h4>
<p>"The Alhambra has been so often and so minutely described by
travellers, that a mere sketch will, probably, be sufficient for
the reader to refresh his recollection; I will give, therefore, a
brief account of our visit to it the morning after our arrival in
Granada.</p>
<p>"Leaving our posada of La Espada, we traversed the renowned
square of the Vivarrambla, once the scene of Moorish jousts and
tournaments, now a crowded market-place. From thence we proceeded
along the Zacatin, the main street of what, in the time of the
Moors, was the Great Bazaar, where the small shops and narrow
allies still retain the Oriental character. Crossing an open place
in front of the palace of the captain-general, we ascended a
confined and winding street, the name of which reminded us of the
chivalric days of Granada. It is called the Calle, or street of the
Gomeres, from a Moorish family famous in chronicle and song. This
street led up to a massive gateway of Grecian architecture, built
by Charles V. forming the entrance to the domains of the
Alhambra.</p>
<p>"At the gate were two or three ragged and superannuated
soldiers, dozing on a stone bench, the successors of the Zegris and
the Abencerrages; while a tall meagre varlet, whose rusty-brown
cloak was evidently intended to conceal the ragged state of his
nether garments, was lounging in the sunshine and gossiping with an
ancient sentinel on duty. He joined us as we entered the gate, and
offered his services to show us the fortress.</p>
<p>"I have a traveller's dislike to officious ciceroni, and did
not-altogether like the garb of the applicant.</p>
<p>"'You are well acquainted with the place, I presume?'</p>
<p>"'Ninguno mas; pues Senor, soy hijo de la
Alhambra.'&mdash;(Nobody better; in fact, Sir, I am a son of the
Alhambra!)</p>
<p>"The common Spaniards have certainly a most poetical way of
expressing themselves. 'A son of the Alhambra!' the appellation
caught me at once; the very tattered garb of my new acquaintance
assumed a dignity in my eyes. It was emblematic of the fortunes of
the place, and befitted the progeny of a ruin.</p>
<p>"I put some farther questions to him, and found that his title
was legitimate. His family had lived in the fortress from
generation to generation ever since the time of the conquest. His
name was Mateo Ximenes. 'Then, perhaps,' said I, 'you may be a
descendant from the great Cardinal Ximenes?'&mdash;'Dios Sabe! God
knows, Senor! It may be so. We are the oldest family in the
Alhambra,&mdash;<i>Christianos Viejos</i>, old Christians, without
any taint of Moor or Jew. I know we belong to some great family or
other, but I forget whom. My father knows all about it: he has the
coat-of-arms hanging up in his cottage, up in the fortress.' There
is not any Spaniard, however poor, but has some claim to high
pedigree. The first title of this ragged worthy, however, had
completely captivated me, so I gladly accepted the services of the
'son of the Alhambra.'</p>
<p>"We now found ourselves in a deep narrow ravine, filled with
beautiful groves, with a steep avenue, and various footpaths
winding through it, bordered with stone seats, and ornamented with
fountains. To our left, we beheld the towers of the Alhambra
beetling above us; to our right, on the opposite side of the
ravine, we were equally dominated by rival towers on a rocky
eminence. These, we were told, were the Torres Vermejos, or
vermilion towers, so called from their ruddy hue. No one knows
their origin. They are of a date much anterior to the Alhambra:
some suppose them to have been built by the Romans; others, by some
wandering colony of Phoenicians. Ascending the steep and shady
avenue, we arrived at the foot of a huge square Moorish tower;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg
340]</span> forming a kind of barbican, through which passed the
main entrance to the fortress. Within the barbican was another
group of veteran invalids, one mounting guard at the portal, while
the rest, wrapped in their tattered cloaks, slept on the stone
benches. This portal is called the Gate of Justice, from the
tribunal held within its porch during the Moslem domination, for
the immediate trial of petty causes: a custom common to the
Oriental nations, and occasionally alluded to in the Sacred
Scriptures.</p>
<p>"The great vestibule or porch of the gate, is formed by an
immense Arabian arch, of the horse-shoe form, which springs to half
the height of the tower. On the key-stone of this arch is engraven
a gigantic hand. Within the vestibule, on the key-stone of the
portal, is sculptured, in like manner, a gigantic key. Those who
pretend to some knowledge of Mahometan symbols, affirm that the
hand is the emblem of doctrine, and the key of faith; the latter,
they add, was emblazoned on the standard of the Moslems when they
subdued Andalusia, in opposition to the Christian emblem of the
Cross. A different explanation, however, was given by the
legitimate son of the Alhambra, and one more in unison with the
notions of the common people, who attach something of mystery and
magic to every thing Moorish, and have all kind of superstitions
connected with this old Moslem fortress.</p>
<p>"According to Mateo, it was a tradition handed down from the
oldest inhabitants, and which he had from his father and
grandfather, that the hand and key were magical devices on which
the fate of the Alhambra depended. The Moorish King who built it
was a great magician, or, as some believed, had sold himself to the
devil, and had laid the whole fortress under a magic spell. By this
means it had remained standing for several hundred years, in
defiance of storms and earthquakes, while almost all other
buildings of the Moors had fallen to ruin, and disappeared. This
spell, the tradition went on to say, would last until the hand on
the outer arch should reach down and grasp the key, when the whole
pile would tumble to pieces, and all the treasures buried beneath
it by the Moors would be revealed.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding this ominous prediction, we ventured to pass
through the spell-bound gateway, feeling some little assurance
against magic art in the protection of the Virgin, a statue of whom
we observed above the portal.</p>
<p>"After passing through the barbican, we ascended a narrow lane,
winding between walls, and came on an open esplanade within the
fortress, called the Plaza de los Algibes, or Place of the
Cisterns, from great reservoirs which undermine it, cut in the
living rock by the Moors for the supply of the fortress. Here,
also, is a well of immense depth, furnishing the purest and coldest
of water; another monument of the delicate taste of the Moors, who
were indefatigable in their exertions to obtain that element in its
crystal purity.</p>
<p>"In front of this esplanade is the splendid pile commenced by
Charles V., intended, it is said, to eclipse the residence of the
Moslem kings. With all its grandeur and architectural merit, it
appeared to us like an arrogant intrusion, and, passing by it, we
entered a simple, unostentatious portal, opening into the interior
of the Moorish palace.</p>
<p>"The transition was almost magical: it seemed as if we were at
once transported into other times and another realm, and were
treading the scenes of Arabian story. We found ourselves in a great
court, paved with white marble, and decorated at each end with
light Moorish peristyles: it is called the Court of the Alberca. In
the centre was an immense basin or fish-pond, a hundred and thirty
feet in length by thirty in breadth, stocked with gold-fish and
bordered by hedges of roses. At the upper end of this court rose
the great Tower of Comares.</p>
<p>"From the lower end we passed through a Moorish archway into the
renowned Court of Lions. There is no part of the edifice that gives
us a more complete idea of its original beauty and magnificence
than this, for none has suffered so little from the ravages of
time. In the centre stands the fountain famous in song and story.
The alabaster basins still shed their diamond drops; and the twelve
lions, which support them, cast forth their crystal streams as in
the days of Boabdil. The court is laid out in flower-beds, and
surrounded by light Arabian arcades of open filagree work,
supported by slender pillars of white marble. The architecture,
like that of all the other parts of the palace, is characterized by
elegance rather than grandeur; bespeaking a delicate and graceful
taste, and a disposition to indolent enjoyment. When one looks upon
the fairy tracery of the peristyles, and the apparently fragile
fretwork of the walls, it is difficult to believe that so much has
survived the wear and tear of centuries, the shocks of earthquakes,
the violence of war, and the quiet, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page341" id="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span> though no less baneful,
pilferrings of the tasteful traveller: it is almost sufficient to
excuse the popular tradition, that the whole is protected by a
magic charm.</p>
<p>"On one side of the court, a portal, richly adorned, opens into
a lofty hall, paved with white marble, and called the Hall of the
Two Sisters. A cupola, or lantern, admits a tempered light from
above, and a free circulation of air. The lower part of the walls
is encrusted with beautiful Moorish tiles, on some of which are
emblazoned the escutcheons of the Moorish monarchs: the upper part
is faced with the fine stucco-work invented at Damascus, consisting
of large plates, cast in moulds, and artfully joined, so as to have
the appearance of having been laboriously sculptured by the hand
into light relievos and fanciful arabesques, intermingled with
texts of the Koran, and poetical inscriptions in Arabian and Cufic
character. These decorations of the walls and cupolas are richly
gilded, and the interstices pencilled with lapis-lazuli, and other
brilliant and enduring colours. On each side of the hall are
recesses for ottomans and couches. Above the inner porch is a
balcony, which communicated with the women's apartments. The
latticed 'jalousies' still remain, from whence the dark-eyed
beauties of the haram might gaze unseen upon the entertainments of
the hall below.</p>
<p>"It is impossible to contemplate this once favourite abode of
Oriental manners without feeling the early associations of Arabian
romance, and almost expecting to see the white arm of some
mysterious princess beckoning from the balcony, or some dark eye
sparkling through the lattice. The abode of beauty is here, as if
it had been inhabited but yesterday; but where are the Zoraydas and
Lindaraxas?</p>
<p>"On the opposite side of the Court of Lions, is the Hall of the
Abencerrages; so called from the gallant cavaliers of that
illustrious line who were here perfidiously massacred. There are
some who doubt the whole truth of this story; but our humble
attendant Mateo pointed out the very wicket of the portal through
which they are said to have been introduced, one by one, and the
white marble fountain in the centre of the hall where they were
beheaded. He showed us also certain broad ruddy stains in the
pavement, traces of their blood, which, according to popular
belief, can never be effaced. Finding we listened to him with easy
faith, he added, that there was often heard at night, in the Court
of Lions, a low, confused sound, resembling the murmuring of a
multitude; with now and then a faint tinkling, like the distant
clank of chains. These noises are probably produced by the bubbling
currents and tinkling falls of water, conducted under the pavement,
through pipes and channels, to supply the fountains; but, according
to the legend of the son of the Alhambra, they are made by the
spirits of the murdered Abencerrages, who nightly haunt the scene
of their suffering, and invoke the vengeance of Heaven on their
destroyer.</p>
<p>"From the Court of Lions we retraced our steps through the Court
of the Alberca, or Great Fishpool; crossing which we proceeded to
the Tower of Comares, so called from the name of the Arabian
architect. It is of massive strength and lofty height, domineering
over the rest of the edifice, and overhanging the steep hill-side,
which descends abruptly to the banks of the Darro. A Moorish
archway admitted us into a vast and lofty hall, which occupies the
interior of the tower, and was the grand audience chamber of the
Moslem monarchs, thence called the Hall of Ambassadors. It still
bears the traces of past magnificence. The walls are richly
stuccoed and decorated with arabesques; the vaulted ceiling of
cedar-wood, almost lost in obscurity, from its height, still gleams
with rich gilding, and the brilliant tints of the Arabian pencil.
On three sides of the saloon are deep windows cut through the
immense thickness of the walls, the balconies of which look down
upon the verdant valley of the Darro, the streets and convents of
the Albaycin, and command a prospect of the distant Vega.</p>
<p>"I might go on to describe minutely the other delightful
apartments of this side of the palace; the Tocador, or toilet of
the queen, an open belvidere, on the summit of a tower, where the
Moorish sultanas enjoyed the pure breezes from the mountain, and
the prospect of the surrounding paradise; the secluded little
patio, or garden of Lindaraxa, with its alabaster fountain, its
thickets of roses and myrtles, of citrons and oranges; the cool
halls and grottoes of the baths, where the glare and heat of day
are tempered into a soft mysterious light, and a pervading
freshness.</p>
<p>"While the city below pants with the noontide heat, and the
parched vega trembles to the eye, the delicate airs from the Sierra
Nevada, play through these lofty halls, bringing with them the
sweetness of the surrounding gardens. Every thing invites to that
indolent repose, the bliss of southern climes; and while the
half-shut eye looks out from <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page342" id="page342"></a>[pg 342]</span> shaded balconies upon
the glittering landscape, the ear is lulled by the rustling of
groves, and the murmur of running streams." Here we must end.</p>
<p>The Sketches bear the very perfection of romance in their
titles. Yes, expectant reader, think of the Alhambra by
Moonlight&mdash;A Ramble among the Hills&mdash;Legend of the
Arabian Astrologer&mdash;The Tower of Las Infantas&mdash;Legends of
the three beautiful Princesses&mdash;The Pilgrim of Love&mdash;The
Rose of the Alhambra,&mdash;the two discreet Statues, &amp;c.
&amp;c. What hours of spell-bound delight do these two volumes lock
up, yet we hope but for a short season, from all who would vary
"life's dull round" with romantic lore.</p>

<h4><i>Hail at Lausanne.</i></h4>
<p>"At Lausanne, on the 14th of July, 1831, about 8 P.M., we
witnessed one of those hail-storms which, every summer, cause such
ravages in the south of Europe. A great proportion of the
hailstones were as big as hen's eggs, and some even bigger: seven
nearly filled a common dinner plate. They were mostly oval or
globular; but one piece, brought to us after the storm, was flat
and square, full 2 in. long, as many broad, and three quarters of
an inch thick, with several projecting knobs of ice as big as large
hazel nuts. This mass exactly resembled a piece of uniformly
transparent ice, but the oval and globular masses had the same
conformation as has often been described in these hailstones, and
on which Volta founded his ingenious but untenable theory of their
formation. In the centre of each was a small, white, opaque
nucleus, the size of a pea, and evidently one of the hailstones
usually seen in England, to which the French give the name of
<i>gr&eacute;sil</i>, confining the term <i>gr&eacute;le</i> to the
larger masses of ice now under our observation. This nucleus of
<i>gresil</i> was enclosed in a coat about half an inch thick of
ice considerably more transparent than it, but still somewhat
opaque, as though of snow melted and then frozen again, and
externally the rest of the mass was of ice perfectly transparent,
and as compact and hard as possible, resounding like a pebble, and
not breaking when thrown on the floor. The inhabitants of Lausanne,
aware that the cinereous and puffed up appearance of the clouds
charged with this tremendous aerial artillery portended more than a
mere thunder-storm, had adopted the precaution of closing their
Venetian shutters; but such windows as were deprived of this
protection had almost every pane broken: and much damage was done
to the tiles of all the houses, and to the gardens and vineyards;
but less than might have been expected, owing to the short duration
of the storm, which did not last longer than seven or eight
minutes, and to the circumstance of the hailstones not being very
numerous."&mdash;(W. Spence.)</p>
<h4><i>Cedar Wood.</i></h4>
<p>"The <i>cedar</i> has been recommended, among other woods, for
the purpose of constructing drawers for cabinets of insects. Let
the inexperienced collector be warned that this is, perhaps, the
<i>very worst</i> wood that can be employed for the purpose; a
strong effluvia, or sometimes a resinous gum, exudes from the wood
of the cedar, which is apt to settle in blotches on the wings of
the specimens, especially of the more delicate Lepid&oacute;ptera,
and entirely discharges the colour. The Rev. Mr. Bree once had a
whole collection of lepidopterous insects utterly spoiled from
having been deposited in cedar drawers; and he has understood,
also, that the insects in the British Museum, collected, he
believes, chiefly by Dr. Leach, have been greatly injured from the
same cause. Possibly, however, cedar wood, after it has been
thoroughly well seasoned, may be less liable to produce these
injurious effects."</p>
<h4><i>Habits of the Common Snake in Captivity.</i></h4>
<p>A Staffordshire Correspondent writes thus familiarly:</p>
<p>"This has been a remarkably good season, both for vegetables and
animals. It has been a singular time for adders, snakes, and
lizards; I never saw so many as I have seen this year in all my
life. I have been trying, a great part of this summer, to
domesticate a common snake, and make it familiar with me and my
children; but all to no purpose, notwithstanding I favoured it with
my most particular attention. It was a most beautiful creature,
only 2 ft. 7 in. long. I did not know how long it had been without
food when I caught it; but I presented it with frogs, toads, worms,
beetles, spiders, mice, and every other delicacy of the season. I
also tried to charm it with music, and my children <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg 343]</span>
stroked and caressed it; but all in vain: it would be no more
familiar with any of us than if we had been the greatest strangers
to it, or even its greatest enemies. I kept it in an old barrel,
out of doors, for the first three weeks: during that time, I can
aver, it ate nothing; but, after a very wet night, it seemed to
suffer from the cold. I then put it into a glass vessel, and set it
on the parlour chimney-piece, covering the vessel with a piece of
silk gauze. I caught two live mice, and put them in to it; but they
would sooner have died of hunger than the snake would have eaten
them: they sat shivering on its back, while it lay coiled up as
round as a ball of worstep. I gave the mice some boiled potatoes,
which they eat: but the snake would eat neither the mice nor the
potatoes. My children frequently took it out in their hands, to
show it to their schoolfellows; but my wife, and some others, could
not bear the sight of it. I one day took it in my hand, and opened
its mouth with a penknife, to show a gentleman how different it was
from that of the adder, which I had dead by me: its teeth being no
more formidable or terrific than the teeth of a trout or eel; while
the mouth of the adder had two fangs, like the claws of a cat,
attached to the roof of the mouth, no way connected with its
jaw-teeth. While examining the snake in this manner, it began to
smell most horridly, and filled the room with an abominable odour;
I also felt, or thought I felt, a kind of prickly numbness in the
hand I held it in, and did so for some weeks afterwards. In
struggling for its liberty, it twisted itself round my arm, and
discharged its excrements on my coat-sleeve, which seemed nothing
more than milk, or like the chalkings of a woodcock. It made its
escape from me several times by boring a hole through the gauze; I
had lost it for some days at one time, when at length it was
observed peeping out of a mouse-hole behind one of the cellar
steps. Whether it had caught any beetles or spiders in the cellar,
I cannot say; but it looked as fierce as a hawk, and hissed and
shook its tongue, as in open defiance. I could not think of hurting
it by smoking it out with tobacco or brimstone; but called it my
fiery dragon which guarded my ale cellar. At length I caught it,
coiled up on one of the steps. I put it again into an American
flour barrel; but it happened not to be the same as he had been in,
and I observed a nail protruding through the staves about half way
up. This, I suppose, he had made use of to help his escape; for he
was missing one morning about ten o'clock: I had seen him at nine
o'clock; so I thought he could not be far off. I looked about for
him for half an hour, when I gave up the hunt in despair. However,
at one o'clock, as the men were going from dinner, one of them
observed the rogue hiding himself under a stone, fifty yards from
the house. 'Dang my buttons,' said he, 'if here is not master's
snake. He came back and told my wife, who told him to go and kill
it. It happened to be <i>washing-day</i>: the washerwoman gave him
a pailful of scalding soapsuds to throw on it; but whether he was
most afraid of me or of the snake is still a question: however, the
washerwoman brought it home with the tongs, and dropped it into the
dolly-tub. It dashed round the tub with the velocity of lightning;
my daughter, seeing its agony, snatched it out of the scalding
liquid, but too late: it died in a few minutes. I was not at all
angry with my wife: I had had my whim, and she had had hers. I had
got all the knowledge I wanted to get; I had learned that it was of
no use for a human being, who requires food three times a day, to
domesticate an animal which can live weeks and months without food:
for, as the saying is, 'Hunger will tame any thing;' and without
hunger you can tame nothing. I have also learned that the serpent,
instead of being the emblem of wisdom, should have been an emblem
of stupidity."</p>
<p>"The stench emitted by the common snake, when molested, is
superlatively noisome; and is given off so powerfully and
copiously, that it infects the air around to a diameter of several
yards. This I witnessed on observing a bitch dog kill a rather
large snake; in which act two points beside the odour effused were
notable. The coils of the snake formed, as it were, a circular
wall; and in the circular space between it, the snake sunk its
head, as if for protection. The dog's efforts were to catch and
crush the head; and, shrivelling up her fleshy lips, 'which all the
while ran froth,' she kept thrusting the points of her jaws into
the circular pit aforesaid, and catching at and fracturing the
head. During the progress of these acts, she, every few seconds,
snorted, and shook off the froth, of which she seemed sedulously
careful to free herself, and barked at the conquered snake. The dog
was a most determined vermin-killer, and in rats, &amp;c., quite an
accomplished one; but snakes did not often come in her
way."&mdash;J.D.</p>

<h3>CURIOUS FACTS IN VEGETATION</h3>
<p>(From Part xiv. of <i>Knowledge for the People, or the Plain Why
and Because.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Why is it improper to consider the turnip a real
bulb?</i></p>
<p>Because it is an intermediate stem which swells into a bulbous
form. Turnips have not been cultivated in England, in fields, more
than a century; but this agricultural practice now yields an annual
return which probably exceeds the interest of our national
debt.&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Scott.</i></p>
<p><i>Why is the Cauliflower so named?</i></p>
<p>Because of its origin from <i>caulis,</i> the stalk of a herb.
Colewort is of a similar origin.</p>
<p><i>Why are the stems of the Cabbage tribe considered wholesome
food?</i></p>
<p>Because their acrid flavour is dipersed among an abundance of
mucilage. Cabbages were commonly used among the ancients, and Cato
wrote volumes on their nature. The Indians had so much veneration
for them, that they swore by cabbages, and were therein as
superstitious as the Egyptians, who gave divine honours to leeks
and onions, for the great benefits which they said they received
from them.&mdash;<i>Lemery on Food.</i></p>
<p><i>Why do Cabbages emit a strong animal odour?</i></p>
<p>Because they contain a great quantity of azote or nitrogen, one
of the ultimate elements of animal matter, and strongly
characterized in the destructive distillation of horn, hoofs, or
bones.</p>
<p><i>Why do not the leaves of the Cabbage remain wet, after being
immersed in water, and again taken out of it?</i></p>
<p>Because they are powdered with a slight layer of resinous
matter, similar to that which covers certain fruits, and, in
particular, plums and grapes. Their sea-green colour is also
attributed to this resinous layer.</p>
<p><i>Why is Quassia so called?</i> Because it was named in honour
of a negro, Quassia, a drunken doctor, who discovered the virtue of
the wood in curing malignant fevers.</p>
<p><i>Why is the Ice plant so called?</i></p>
<p>Because its stem is covered with soft tubercles, or
excrescences, which have a crystalline appearance.</p>
<p><i>Why do the leaves of some trees fall very early?</i></p>
<p>Because they are articulated to the branch; that is, they do not
unite with it by the whole of their base, but are simply fixed to
it by a kind of contraction or articulation; as in the maple and
horse chestnut.</p>
<p><i>Why do leaves fall at the approach of winter?</i></p>
<p>Because a separation takes place, either in the foot-stalk, or
more usually at its base, and the dying part quits the vigorous
one, which is promoted by the weight of the leaf itself, or the
action of the gales that blow in autumn on its expanded form. M.
Richard explains the cause more philosophically: "Although the fall
of the leaves generally takes place at the approach of winter, cold
is not to be considered as the principal cause of this phenomenon.
It is much more natural to attribute it to the cessation of
vegetation, and the want of nourishment which the leaves experience
at that season, when the course of the sap is interrupted. The
vessels of the leaf contract, dry up, and soon after, that organ is
detached from the twig on which it had been developed."</p>
<p><i>Why do some trees, as the Oak, the Beech, and the Hornbeam,
retain their leaves to a late period of autumn?</i></p>
<p>Because the life of the twigs on which they grow is not
sufficiently vigorous to throw them off, after the brown colour
indicates that they are dead.</p>
<p><i>Why have some plants been termed the Poor Man's
Weather-glass?</i></p>
<p>Because they shut up their flowers against the approach of rain.
Linnaeus, however, thinks, that flowers lose their fine
sensibility, after the anthers have performed their office, or when
deprived of them artificially. Sir James Smith also observes, that
some species are sometimes exhausted by continued wet; "and it is
evident that very sudden thunder showers often take such flowers by
surprise, the previous state of the atmosphere not having been such
as to give them due warning."</p>
<p>Many flowers have a regular time of opening and shutting. We
have already mentioned the Marigold; the goat's-beard is vulgarly
called "John go-to-bed at noon," from its closing at mid-day; and
at the Cape of Good Hope there is a "four o'clock flower," because
it invariably closes at that time. The common daisy is, however, a
readier example, its name being a compound of day's and
eye&mdash;Day's-eye, in which way, indeed, it is written by Ben
Johnson. It regularly shuts after sun-set, to expand again with the
morning light. Thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The little dazie, that at evening closes.&mdash;<i>Spenser.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>By a daisy, whose leaves spread,</p>
<p>Shut when Titian goes to bed.&mdash;<i>G. Withers.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Leyden sings of moist or rainy weather foretold by daisies. Thus
we may examine a whole field, and not find a daisy open, except
such as have their flowering nearly over, and have in consequence
lost their sensibility.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg
345]</span> <p>The daisy is one of the pet flowers of the poets.
Chaucer is ecstatic in its praise, and calls it his "owne hartes'
rest;" Burns, "Wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower;" and Wordsworth,
in beautiful and touching simplicity, has addressed several poems
to "the poet's darling."</p>
<p>Appended to Richard's valuable "Elements," is the <i>Horologium
Florae,</i> (timepiece of Flora,) or a table of the hours at which
certain plants expand and shut, at Upsal, 60 deg. north latitude.
The earliest Meadow Salsafy opens from 3 to 4 A.M.; and closes from
9 to 10 A.M. The latest A.M. is the <i>Mesembryanthemum
Modiflorum,</i> (used in the manufacture of Maroquin leather,)
which opens 10 to 11 A.M., and closes at 12 P.M. The latest opening
P.M. is the <i>Cactus Grandiflorus,</i> 9 to 10 P.M., and closing
at 12 P.M., thus remaining open only two or three hours. Other
flowers, we may add, are so peculiarly delicate, as scarcely to
bear the contact of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Forster, in his "Researches about Atmospheric Phenomena,"
notices several prognostics of the weather by plants. Thus,
Chickweed has been said to be an excellent weather-guide. When the
flower expands freely, no rain need be feared for a long time. In
showery days the flower appears half concealed, and this state may
be regarded as indicative of showery weather; when it is entirely
shut, we may expect a rainy day. If the flowers of the Siberian
sowthistle remain open all night, we may expect rain next day.
Before showers, the trefoil contracts its leaves. Lord Bacon
observes, that the trefoil has its stalk more erect against rain.
He also mentions a small red flower, growing in stubble-fields,
called by the country people <i>wincopipe</i>, which, if it opens
in the morning, assures us of a fine day.</p>

<h2>Travels</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Pen and Pencil Sketches of India, being the Journal of a Tour
in India. By Captain Mundy.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are two very amusing volumes of scenes and situations full
of stirring interest, as their criticships would say&mdash;for
example the four extracts immediately following:</p>
<h4><i>Palankeen Travelling and a Sortie of Tigers.</i></h4>
<p>"To those unitiated into the mysteries of Indian travelling, the
prospect of a journey of six hundred miles, night and day, in a hot
climate, inclosed in a sort of coffin-like receptacle, carried on
the shoulders of men, is somewhat alarming; but to one more
accustomed to that method of locomotion, the palankeen would,
perhaps, prove less fatiguing and harassing, for a long journey,
than any other conveyance.</p>
<p>"The horizontal or reclining position is naturally the most easy
to the body; and the exhaustion consequent upon a journey in the
heat of the day, generally secures to the traveller as much sleep
during the cooller hours of the night, as the frequent
interruptions of the bearers at the several stages will allow him
to enjoy. I had laid in a good store of tea, sugar, and biscuits, a
novel, some powder and shot, a gun, and a sword, and plenty of
blankets, as a defence against the coldness of the night. Our
baggage consisted of a dozen boxes (patarras) appended to bamboos,
and carried by men: these, with two torch-bearers (mussalgees) to
each palankeen, completed our cavalcade.</p>
<p>"Nov. 24th, 7 A.M., reached Hazarebaug, a small station, about
two hundred and twenty miles from Calcutta. It is a healthy spot;
the earth sandy and rocky, presenting a strong contrast to the
loomy and alluvial soil of Southern Bengal. From
Rogonn&acirc;thpore to Hazarebaug the road runs through an almost
uninterrupted jungle, swarming with wild beasts. At this place we
met with a hospitable friend, who stored our palankeens with
provisions, after giving us a capital breakfast.</p>
<p>"At eleven o'clock at night we entered the famous pass of
Dunghye. The road bears the appearance of a deep sandy ravine; the
banks are rocky and woody, and in many places quite overhung by the
forest-trees. We had accomplished about half the defile, when I was
suddenly and rudely awakened from a dozing sleep by the shock of my
palankeen coming to the ground, and by the most discordant shouts
and screams. I jumped out to ascertain the cause of the uproar, and
found, on inquiry, that a foraging party of tigers&mdash;probably
speculating upon picking up a straggling bearer&mdash;had sprung
off the rocks, and dashed across the road, bounding between my
palankeen and that of Colonel D., who was scarcely ten yards
a-head. The bearers of both palankeens were all huddled together,
bellowing like bedlamites, and the mussalgees waving their torches
most vehemently. On mustering our forces, we discovered that two of
our patarra-bearers were missing, and fearing that the tigers might
pick them up, we dispatched four men with spare torches to bring
them on. Meanwhile <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id=
"page346"></a>[pg 346]</span> my friend and myself, having brought
our palankeens together, armed ourselves with patience and a pair
of pistols to await the result. The whole incident, with the time
and scene, was highly interesting and wild, with just enough of the
awful to give an additional piquancy. The night was dark and
stormy, and the wind roared among the trees above our heads: the
torches cast a red and flickering light on the rocks in our
immediate neighbourhood, and just showed us enough of the depths of
the forest to make the back ground more gloomy and unfathomable.
The distant halloos of the men who were gone in search of their
comrades, came faintly and wildly upon the breeze; and the
occasional shots that we fired rang through the rocky jungle with
an almost interminable echo. In about three quarters of an hour our
bearers joined us, together with the two patarra-bearers. These
latter, hearing the vociferations of our men, and guessing the
cause, had quietly placed their boxes on the ground, about a mile
in the rear of us, and seating themselves on their heels, had
determined not to proceed until the break of day.</p>
<p>"All being reported present, we resumed our journey, the men
screaming chorus to scare our unwelcome visitors, whom I several
times fancied I heard rustling among the brushwood on the road
side, as though they were moving on our flanks in order to cut off
any straggler who might drop astern. I never saw bearers go more
expeditiously, or in more compact order, every man fearing to be
the last in the cavalcade.<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> A sheet
would have covered the whole party! The tigers, if they had
calculated upon one of our number for their evening meal, must have
gone supperless to their lair, for we mustered all our twenty-four
men in the morning. A d&acirc;k hurkarah (post messenger) had been
carried off in the same spot two days before, probably by the same
family of tigers, which according to the bearer's account,
consisted of two old ones, and three cubs.</p>
<h4><i>Wild Beast Fights</i>.</h4>
<p>"Early in the morning, the whole party, including ladies, eager
for the novel spectacle, mounted elephants, and repaired to the
private gate of the royal palace, where the King met the
Commander-in-Chief, and conducted him and his company to a palace
in the park, in one of the courts of which the arena for the
combats was prepared. In the centre was erected a gigantic cage of
strong bamboos, about fifty feet high, and of like diameter, and
rooffed with rope network. Sundry smaller cells, communicating by
sliding doors with the main theatre, were tenanted by every species
of the savagest inhabitants of the forest. In the large cage,
crowded together, and presenting a formidable front of broad,
shaggy foreheads well armed with horns, stood a group of buffaloes
sternly awaiting the conflict, with their rear scientifically
appuy&eacute; against the bamboos. The trap-doors being lifted, two
tigers, and the same number of bears and leopards, rushed into the
centre. The buffaloes instantly commenced hostilities, and made
complete shuttlecocks of the bears, who, however, finally escaped
by climbing up the bamboos beyond the reach of their horned
antagonists. The tigers, one of which was a beautiful animal, fared
scarcely better; indeed, the odds were much against them, there
being five buffaloes. They appeared, however to be no match for
these powerful creatures, even single-handed, and showed little
disposition to be the assaulters. The larger tiger was much gored
in the head, and in return took a mouthful of his enemy's dewlap,
but was finally (as the fancy would describe it) 'bored to the
ropes and floored.' The leopards seemed throughout the conflict
sedulously to avoid a breach of the peace.</p>
<p>"A rhinoceros was next let loose in open courtyard, and the
attendants attempted to induce him to pick a quarrel with a tiger
who was chained to a ring. The rhinoceros appeared, however, to
consider a fettered foe as quite beneath his enmity; and having
once approached the tiger, and quietly surveyed him, as he writhed
and growled, expecting the attack, turned suddenly round and
trotted awkwardly off to the yard gate, where he capsized a
palankeen which was carrying away a lady fatigued with the sight of
these unfeminine sports.</p>
<p>"A buffalo and tiger were the next combatants: they attacked
furiously, the tiger springing at the first onset on the other's
head, and tearing his neck severely; but he was quickly dismounted,
and thrown with such violence as nearly to break his back, and
quite to disable him from renewing the combat.</p>
<p>"A small elephant was next impelled to attack a leopard. The
battle was short and decisive; the former falling on his knees, and
thrusting his blunted tusks nearly through his antagonist.</p>
<p>"On our return from the beast fight a breakfast awaited us at
the royal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id=
"page347"></a>[pg 347]</span> palace; and the white tablecloth
being removed, quails, trained for the purpose, were placed upon
the green cloth, and fought most gamely, after the manner of the
English cockpit. This is an amusement much in fashion among the
natives of rank, and they bet large sums on their birds, as they
lounge luxuriously round, smoking their houkahs.</p>
<h4><i>Hunting with Leopards.</i></h4>
<p>"The leopards are each accommodated with a flat-topped cart,
without sides, drawn by two bullocks, and each animal has two
attendants. They are loosely bound by a collar and rope to the back
of the vehicle, and are also held by the keeper by a strap round
the loins. A leathern hood covers their eyes. The antelopes being
excessively timid and wild, the best way to enjoy the sport is to
sit on the cart alongside the driver; for the vehicle being built
like the hackeries of the peasants, to the sight of which the deer
are accustomed, it is not difficult, by skilful management, to
approach within two hundred yards of the game. On this occasion we
had three chetahs in the field, and we proceeded towards the spot
where the herd had been seen, in a line, with an interval of about
one hundred yards between each cart. On emerging from a
cotton-field, we came in sight of four antelopes, and my driver
managed to get within one hundred yards of them ere they took
alarm. The chetah was quickly unhooded, and loosed from his bonds;
and as soon as he viewed the deer he dropped quietly off the cart,
on the <i>opposite</i> side to that on which they stood, and
approached them at a slow, crouching canter, masking himself by
every bush and inequality of ground which lay in in his way. As
soon, however, as they began to show alarm, he quickened his pace,
and was in the midst of the herd in a few bounds.</p>
<p>"He singled out a doe, and ran it close for about two hundred
yards, when he reached it with a blow of his paw, rolled it over,
and in an instant was sucking the life-blood from its throat.</p>
<p>"One of the other chetahs was slipped at the same time, but
after making four or five desperate bounds, by which he nearly
reached his prey, suddenly gave up the pursuit, and came growling
sulkily back to his cart.</p>
<p>"As soon as the deer is pulled down, a keeper runs up, hoods the
chetah cuts the victim's throat, and receiving some of the blood in
a wooden ladle, thrusts it under the leopard's nose. The antelope
is then dragged away, and placed in a receptacle under the hackery,
whilst the chetah is rewarded with a leg for his pains."<a id=
"footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h4><i>An Alligator in the Ganges.</i></h4>
<p>"A beautiful specimen of an alligator's head was here given by
Mr. Alexander to Lord Combermere. He was rather a distinguished
monster, having carried off at different occasions, six or eight
brace of men from an indigo factory in the neighbourhood. A native,
who had long laid wait for him, at length succeeded in slaying him
with poisoned arrows. One of these notoriously ghaut-frequenting
alligators is well nigh as rich a prize to the poor native who is
fortunate enough to capture him, as a Spanish galleon is to a
British frigate; for on ripping open his stomach, and over-hauling
its freight, it is not unfrequently found to contain 'a choice
assortment'&mdash;as the Calcutta advertisers have it&mdash;of
gold, silver, or brass bangles and anklets, which have not been so
expeditiously digested as their fair owners, victims of the
monster's voracity. A little fat Brahminee child, 'farci an ris,'
must be a tempting and tender <i>bonne bouche</i> to these river
gourmands. Horrific legends such as the above, together with a
great deal of valuable advice on the subject, were quite thrown
away upon me; for ninety degrees of Fahrenheit, and the enticing
blueness of the water generally betrayed me into a plunge every
evening during my Gangetic voyage."</p>
<h4><i>Nocturnal Bathing.</i></h4>
<p>"On the occasion of a grand nocturnal bathing ceremony, held at
the great tank called the Indra Dam&acirc;n, I went with a party of
three or four others to witness the spectacle. The walls
surrounding the pool and a cluster of picturesque pavilions in its
centre were brilliantly lighted up with hundreds of cheraugs, or
small oil-lamps, casting a flickering lustre upon the heads and
shoulders of about five hundred men, women, and children, who were
ducking and praying, <i>&agrave; corps perdu,</i> in the water. As
I glanced over the figures nearest to me, I discovered floating
among the indifferent bathers two dead bodies, which had either
been drowned in the confusion, or had purposely come to die on the
edge of the sacred tank; the cool and apathetic survivors taking
not the slightest notice of their soulless neighbours."</p>
<h4><i>King John at the Cape.</i></h4>
<p>"The largest house in Simon's Town, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg 348]</span> and,
indeed, the greater part of the town itself, belongs to an
Englishman of the name of Osbond, who, however, is more generally
known by the dignified title of 'King John.' He was carpenter on
board the sixty-gun ship Sceptre, which was wrecked off this coast
some yearn ago. Like Juan, he escaped the sea, and like Juan he
found a Haidee. Being well-favoured and sharp-witted, he won the
heart and the hand of a wealthy Dutch widow, whose dollars he
afterwards, in some bold but successful speculations, turned to
good account. He is said to have laid out ten thousand pounds on
these&mdash;to every one but himself&mdash;<i>inhospita
littora.</i> King John is much respected."</p>
<h4><i>Population of Cape Town.</i></h4>
<p>"The variety of nations, and the numerous shades of complexion
among the people in the streets of Cape Town, are very striking to
a stranger. First may be remarked the substantial Dutchman, with
his pretty, smiling, round-faced, and particularly well-dressed
daughter: then the knot of 'Qui hi's,' sent to the Cape, per
doctor's certificate, to husband their threadbare constitutions,
and lavish their rupees: next the obsequious, smirking,
money-making China-man, with his poking shoulders, and whip-like
pig-tail: then the stout, squat Hottentots&mdash;who resemble the
Dutch in but one characteristic!&mdash;and half castes of every
intermediate tint between black and white. These are well relieved
and contrasted by the tall, warlike figures and splendid costume of
his Majesty's 72nd Highlanders, who, with the 98th regiment, form
the garrison of Cape Town."</p>
<h4><i>Visit to the Residence of Napoleon at St. Helena.</i></h4>
<p>"We soon came in sight of the level plateau of the Longwood
estate, the residence of the late emperor, and six miles from
Plantation House. Here the country gradually assumes a more
desolate and a wilder look; and the English visitor arrives at the
unfortunate and unwelcome conclusion, that the best part of the
island was not given to the illustrious captive. One cannot avoid
agreeing with Sir W. Scott, that Plantation House should have been
accorded to him, in spite of the detering reasons of its vicinity
to the sea, and its sequestered situation. Longwood, however, has
better roads, more space for riding or driving, and in summer must
have been much cooler than the less sheltered parts of the isle. As
we turned through the lodges the old house appeared at the end of
an avenue of scrubby and weather-worn trees. It bears the exterior
of a respectable farm-house, but is now fast running to decay. On
entering a dirty courtyard, and quitting our horses, we were shown
by some idlers into a square building, which once contained the
bed-room, sitting-room, and bath of the <i>Empereur des
Fran&ccedil;ois.</i> The partitions and floorings are now thrown
down, and torn up, and the apartments occupied for six years by the
hero before whom kings, emperors, and popes had quailed, are now
tenanted by cart-horses!</p>
<p>"Passing on with a groan, I entered a small chamber, with two
windows looking towards the north. Between these windows are the
marks of a fixed sofa: on that couch Napoleon died. The apartment
is now occupied by a threshing machine; 'No bad emblem of its
former tenant!' said a sacrilegious wag. Hence we were conducted
onwards to a large room, which formerly contained a billiard-table,
and whose front looks out upon a little latticed veranda, where the
imperial peripatetic&mdash;I cannot style him
philosopher&mdash;enjoyed the luxury of six paces to and
fro,&mdash;his favourite promenade. The white-washed walls are
scored with names of every nation; and the paper of the ceiling has
been torn off in strips as holy relics. Many couplets, chiefly
French, extolling and lamenting the departed hero, adorn or
disfigure (according to their qualities) the plaster walls. The
only lines that I can recall to mind&mdash;few are worth
it&mdash;are the following, written ever the door, and signed
'&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, Officier de la Garde
Imp&eacute;riale.'</p>

Marengo, and Austerlitz, amused himself by erecting a mock battery.
The little chunamed tank, in which he fed some fresh-water fish, is
quite dried up; and the mud wall, through a hole in which he
reconnoitered passers-by, is, like the great owner, returned to

<h2>Recent French Literature.</h2>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A novel picture of Paris has lately appeared with the taking
title of the <i>Hundred and One.</i> Its origin, as well as its
subject, is interesting. It is a voluntary association of almost
all the literary talent of France, for the benefit of an
enterprising bookseller, whose affairs have, it seems, fallen into
the sere, since the commercial embarrassments following on the
Revolution. A hundred and one authors of all ranks and political
opinions, philosophers, academicians, journalists, deputies, poets,
artists, have combined in this work to pass in review before us the
humours, follies and opinions of the French capital, painted in
colours gay or grave, sketchy or elaborate, according to the manner
or mood of the artist. A very amusing work, suitable to all tastes,
is the result, and, by aid of the <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>,
we are enabled to present the reader with a specimen sketch by Leon
Guzlan, an author of some celebrity in this species of
writing.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
"#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h4>VISIT TO THE MORGUE, AT PARIS.</h4>
<p>(The Morgue, we should premise, is an establishment in Paris for
the reception of all persons found dead in the City or its
environs. Thither it is the duty of the police to convey the
bodies, where they are exposed in a hall open to the public for a
stated time,<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
"#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> when, if not identified, and claimed,
they are interred in the neighbouring cemetery.)</p>
<p>"After describing the exterior, the <i>Salle de
l'Exposition</i>, which is the only portion of the building, of
course, with which the public are acquainted, the writer conducts
us into the inner recesses of this house of death, the apartments
of the superintendant.</p>
<p>"M. Perrin, is a little old man, who coughs incessantly. When I
explained to him the object of my visit, he very politely offered
to show me all the details of his administration, regretting much,
as he said, that there was not so much variety as could be desired.
'But I will show you what I have&mdash;be pleased to walk up.'</p>
<p>"As we were climbing the narrow stairs, and he was informing me
that his establishment was connected both with the prefecture and
the police, with the one on account of the local expenses, with the
other from its connexion with the public health, we were obliged to
stand close against the wall to allow a troop of young girls to
pass, well dressed, gay, but shivering with the cold, which blew
from the river through the chink which lighted the stair.</p>
<p>"'These are four of my daughters. I have eight children.
Fran&ccedil;ois, the keeper, has had four, and he has had the good
fortune to get them all married. Fran&ccedil;ois is a kind
father.'</p>
<p>"'So,' said I, 'twelve children then have been born in the
Morgue. Dreams of joy, and conjugal endearments, and parental
delights, have been experienced in this chamber of death. Marriage
with its orange flowers, baptism with its black robed sponsors, the
communion, and the embroidered veil, love, religion, virtue, have
had their home here as elsewhere. God has sown the seeds of
happiness every where.'</p>
<p>"'Papa, we are going to a distribution of prizes. My sisters are
sure to get a prize. Don't weary, we will be back in good
time.'</p>
<p>"'Go, my children,'&mdash;and all four embraced him.</p>
<p>"I thought of the body of the little Norman in the dreary room
beneath, and of the mother who even now, perhaps, was anxiously
looking for her from the window.</p>
<p>"'This is the apartment of Fran&ccedil;ois'. Fran&ccedil;ois did
the honours with the activity of a man who is not ashamed of his
establishment. His room is comfortably furnished; two modern
pendules mounted on bronze, a wardrobe with a Medusa's head, a high
bed, and a handsome rose-coloured curtain. If the room was not
overburdened with furniture, if there was not much of luxury, yet,
to those not early accustomed to superfluities, it might even seem
gay. It represented the tastes, opinions, and habits of its master.
Vases of flowers threw a green reflection on the curtains, for
Fran&ccedil;ois is fond of flowers. Among his gallery of portraits
were those of Augereau and Kleber, both in long coats, leaning on
immense sabres, with peruques and powder. Napoleon is there three
times.</p>
<p>"'Look at these jars,' said Fran&ccedil;ois, 'these are
sweetmeats of my wife's making; she excels in sweetmeats.' I read
upon them, 'gooseberries of 1831.' We left Fran&ccedil;ois's
apartment <span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id=
"page350"></a>[pg 350]</span> which forms the right wing of the
Morgue, while the clerk's house is on the left, and entered the
cabinet of administration of M. Perrin.</p>
<p>"If Fran&ccedil;ois is fond of flowers, M. Perrin has the same
penchant for hydraulics and the camera obscura; he draws, he makes
jets from the Seine, by an ingenious piece of machinery of his own
invention; while he was retouching his syphon, I asked permission
to turn over the register, where suicides are ranged in two
columns.</p>
<p>"The fatal 'unknown' was the prevailing designation; 'brought
here at three in the morning, skull fractured, <i>unknown;</i>'
'brought at twelve at night, drowned under the Pont des Arts, cards
in his pocket, <i>unknown;</i>'&mdash;'young woman, pregnant,
crushed by a fiacre at the corner of the Rue Mandar,
<i>unknown</i>;'&mdash;'new born child found dead of cold, at the
gate of an hotel, <i>unknown.'</i></p>
<p>"I said to M. Perrin that he must weary here very much
occasionally during the long nights of winter.</p>
<p>"'No,' replied he good humouredly, 'the children sing, we all
work, Fran&ccedil;ois and I play at draughts or piquet; the worst
of it is, we are sometimes interrupted; a knock comes, we must go
down, get a stone ready, undress the new comer and register him:
that spoils the game; we forget to mark the points.'</p>
<p>"'And this is the way you generally spend your
evenings?'&mdash;'Always, except when Fran&ccedil;ois has to go to
Vaugirard at four o'clock: then he must go to bed earlier. Perhaps
you do not know that our burying ground is at Vaugirard: as that
burying ground is not much in fashion, we have been allowed to
retain our privilege of having a fosse to ourselves.'</p>
<p>"'I understand,&mdash;it is a fief of the Morgue.'</p>
<p>"'You saw that chariot below near the entrance gate, in which
the children were hiding themselves at play,&mdash;that is our
hearse.'</p>
<p>"'And rich or poor, all must make use of your conveyance? If for
instance a suicide is recognised, his relations or friends may
reclaim him, take him home, and bestow the rites of sepulture on
him at his own house?'</p>
<p>"'No, the Morgue does not give back what has been once deposited
here. It allows the funeral ceremonies to be as pompous as they
will, but they must all set out from hence; one end of the
procession perhaps is at Notre Dame, while the other is starting
from the Morgue. The Archbishop of Paris may be there; but
Fran&ccedil;ois's place is fixed. It is the first.'</p>
<p>"'And the priests of Notre Dame, do they never make any
difficulty about administering the funeral rites to your dead?'</p>
<p>"'Never!'</p>
<p>"'Not even to the suicides?'</p>
<p>"'There are no suicides for Notre Dame: one is drowned by
accident, another killed by the bursting of a gun, a third has
fallen from a scaffold. I invent the excuse, and the conscience of
the priest accepts it. That's enough.'</p>
<p>"So, thought I! Notre Dame, which formerly witnessed the
execution at the stake of sorcerers, alchymists, and gipsies on the
Grande Place, has now no word of reprobation for the carcass of the
suicide, once allowed to rot on the ground, or be devoured by
birds. She asks not here what was his faith. The priest says
mildly, 'Peace be with you.'</p>
<p>"We walked down, and Fran&ccedil;ois opened the first room, that
which contains the dresses; habits of all shapes, all dimensions,
hideously jumbled together; gaiters pinned to a sleeve, a shawl
shading the neck of a coat; dresses of peasants, workmen, carters
and brewers' frocks, women's gowns, all faded, discoloured,
shapeless, flap against each other in the current of air which
entered through the windows. There is something here appalling in
the sight and sound of these objects, soulless, body-less, yet
moving as if they had life, and presenting the form without the
flesh. Your eye rests on a handkerchief, the property of some poor
labourer, suddenly seized with the idea of suicide, after some day
that he has wanted work.</p>
<p>"Fran&ccedil;ois, who followed the direction of my eyes to see
what impression the picture produced on me sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"'Does it move you too,' said I? 'Are you discontented with your
lot.&mdash;Unhappy?'</p>
<p>"'Not exactly! But, Sir, formerly, you must know, the dresses,
after being six months exhibited, became a perquisite of ours; we
sold them. Now they talk of taking the dresses from us.'</p>
<p>"I reassured Fran&ccedil;ois as to the intention of government,
and assured him there was no talk of taking away the dresses.</p>
<p>"The second room, that which adjoins the public exhibition room,
is appropriated for the dissection of those, the mode of whose
death appears to the police to be suspicious. Its only furniture is
a marble table, on which the dissections take place, and a shelf on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg
351]</span> which are placed several bottles of chlorate. This room
is immediately above the room of M. Perrin. The dissecting table
above just answers to the girls' piano below.</p>
<p>"In this room, which I crossed rapidly to avoid as much as
possible the sight of a body extended on the plank, I saw the
little girl, who had been stifled the night before in the
diligence; she was a lovely child. The other figure was frightfully
disfigured; scarcely even would his mother have recognised him.</p>
<p>"There remained only the public room; it is narrow, ill aired;
ten or twelve black and sloping stones receive the suicides, who
are placed on it almost in a state of nudity; the places are seldom
all occupied, except perhaps during a revolution. Then it is that
the Morgue is recruited; two more days of glory and immortality in
July, and the plague had been in Paris.</p>
<p>"'It is true,' said M. Perrin, 'we worked hard during the three
days, and we were allowed the use of two assistants. Corpses every
where, within, without, at the gate, on the bank.'&mdash;</p>
<p>"'And your girls?'</p>
<p>"'During these days they did not leave their apartment, nor
looked out to the street, nor to the river; besides, you are
mistaken if you think the spectacle would have terrified them.
Brought up here, they will walk at night without a light in front
of the glass, which divides the corpses from the public, without
trembling; we become accustomed to any thing.'</p>
<p>"Methought I heard the poor children, so familiar with the idea
of death, so accustomed to this domestic spectacle of their
existence, asking innocently of the strangers whom they
visited,&mdash;as one would ask where is your garden, your kitchen,
or your cabinet,&mdash;'where do <i>you</i> keep your dead
here?'</p>
<p>"These were all the facts I could gather with regard to the
establishment. I was opening the glass door to breathe the fresh
air again, when the entrance of the crowd drove me back into the
interior; they were following a bier, on which lay a body, from
which the water dripped in a long stream. From one of the hands
which were closely clenched, the keeper detached a strip of
coloured linen, and a fragment of lace. 'Ah!' said he, 'let me
look, 'tis she!'</p>
<p>"'Who is it?'</p>
<p>"'The nurse who was here this morning; the nurse of the little
Norman girl. Good! they may be buried together.' And M. Perrin put
on his spectacles, opened his register, and wrote in his best
current-hand&mdash;<i>unknown!</i>"</p>

<h2>Poetry.</h2>
<hr class="short" />
<h4><i>The Maid of Elvar. By Allan Cunningham.</i></h4>
<p>This is one of the most gratifying "appearances" in the
literature of the day. It reminds us that however the poet's harp
may have remained unstrung, it has not lost its vigour or
sweetness&mdash;its depth of feeling, or its melody of tone, and
these too are ably sustained through nearly 600 stanzas in an
exquisitely embellished narrative. The poem is "a song of other
times;" the story is one of chivalrous love; the hero is a young
warrior and poet; the Maid of Elvar offers a garland of gold for
the best song in honour of one of his victories; "minstrels meet
and sing, but the song of Eustace, though on another theme, is
reckoned the best; the Maid hangs the gold chain round his neck,
and retires, admiring the young stranger;" and thereby hangs the
tale. As our limits will not allow us to detach a scene or
incident, we must be content, for the present, with culling a few
of the choicest flowers of the song.</p>
<h4>CIVIL WAR.</h4>
<div class="poem">

<p>Woe, woe was ours. Chief drew his sword on chief:</p>

<p>Our glass of glory sank nigh its last sand;</p>
<p>Rank with its treason, priesthood with its craft,</p>

<h4>THE MAID'S FIRST LOVE.</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The maiden heard a light foot on the floor,</p>
<p>And sidelong looked, and there before her stood</p>
<p>Young Eustace Graeme: far from the pasture moor</p>
<p>He came: the fragrance of the dale and wood</p>
<p>Was scenting all his garments green and good.</p>
<p>A sudden flush when tie the maiden saw,</p>
<p>Burned through his temples, kindled up his blood&mdash;</p>
<p>His stifling breath waxed nigh too tight to draw,</p>
<p>He bowed, and silent stood in wonderment and awe.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The father smiled, the mother smiled. Now why</p>
<p>Are her eyes downcast and his white brow glowing?</p>
<p>Say, have they vowed while heaven was witness by</p>
<p>With all her radiant lights like fountains flowing,</p>
<p>To love while water runs and woods are growing,</p>
<p>And stars glowed conscious of the compact pure?</p>
<p>They never woo'd, nor, love for love bestowing.</p>
<p>Met with the moonshine in the green-wood bow'r,</p>
<p>Nor looked and sighed, and looked and drank love by the
hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yet they have met. Though not fools of the flock,</p>
<p>On whom love like the tiger gives one bound.</p>
<p>And then the heart is rent&mdash;a thunderstroke</p>
<p>That makes men dust before they hear the sound&mdash;</p>
<p>A shaft that leaves dark venom in the wound&mdash;</p>
<p>A frost that all the buds of manhood nips&mdash;</p>
<p>A sea of passion in which true love's drowned&mdash;</p>
<p>A demon strangling virtue in his grips&mdash;</p>
<p>A day when reason's son is quenched in dread eclipse.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>True gentle love is like the summer dew,</p>
<p>Which falls around when all is still and hush&mdash;</p>
<p>And falls unseen until its bright drops strew</p>
<p>With odours, herb and flower, and bank, and bush</p>
<p>O love, when womanhood is in the flush,</p>
<p>And man's a young and an unspotted thing!</p>
<p>His first breathed word and her half conscious blush,</p>
<p>Are fair us light in heaven, or flowers in spring&mdash;</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
